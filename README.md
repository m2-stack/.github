# Welcome to M2

M2 is a an all-around application stack focused on providing the developers using it a suite of tools, workflows, and opinionated configurations for a variety of front-end applications, back-end services, common tooling configuration, and other goodies that will supercharge your developer abilities and will allow you to write modular well-organized code that you can leverage to build top-of-the-line state-of-the-art apps.

With M2 you will be able to focus on building your apps *The Right Way™️* from prototype, through MVP, and then take your code to the next level to full blown production grade software, utilizing previously composed modules, components, and setups not having to throw it away because you had to ship, ship, SHIP!

More to come soon... Stay tuned!
